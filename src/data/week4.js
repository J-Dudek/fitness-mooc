                content: `Everyone has heard of stretching, but should it be done before or after training? Are they necessary? How to do them?

                So many questions to clear up! Stretching is often used very little, poorly executed, or even poorly understood, especially from the point of view of its interests.
                In addition, it is important that you incorporate a stretching routine whether you exercise or not. Many of us have sedentary jobs; so we sit for a good part of the day, which has the effect of shortening our muscles and making them stiffer.
                First, let's give a simple definition of what a stretch is: it's the action of lengthening or stretching tendons, muscles, and fibrous tissue with varying amounts of force.
                
                Stretching is rather used to designate a session entirely devoted to stretching.

                content: `The practice of muscle stretching developed around thirty years ago in sports, following the work of North American and Scandinavian authors. Improving flexibility was the primary goal of these stretches, which have long been used in dance. But in sports medicine, the re-education techniques for neurological conditions, known as proprioceptive neuromuscular facilitation, developed by Kabat and other authors. It was in the early 1980s that Stanish in North America and other authors in France introduced stretching to the management of sport-related tendinopathies. Then Stanish et al. eccentric muscular work was associated with it a few years later. Although initially based on theoretical rather than experimental data, this method has developed rapidly to become a must in the preparation of athletes and in the treatment of tendon and muscle injuries related to sport. In recent years, methods of evaluating the effects of stretching have been developed and controlled studies have been published, providing scientific support for this technique and allowing to better define its place among other training and treatment techniques.`

                During a stretching exercise, you will act on the so-called striated muscles (see The three types of muscles); they are connected to a tendon or a ligament. To put it simply, in this process, you stretch both the muscle, the tendon and the ligament which is very little stretchy.
                
                Now that you have fully understood the elements involved in stretching, we are going to tackle a part that you all expect: the benefits!

                content: `Active or activo-dynamic stretching is used to participate in muscle warming up and thus increase body temperature. They should be done before exercise, because they prepare the muscle, tendons and ligaments to undergo a more or less intense exercise of strength. This is why these stretches are widely used in high performance sport.
                
                The technique consists of:
                
                Lengthen the muscle slowly and gradually until you feel tight.
                Contract the muscle in a static position for 6 to 8 seconds (feeling hot).
                Release and follow up on a phase of dynamic muscle work in the form of active exercises for about ten seconds (see section "How to stretch?" For a better understanding). Here, the lengthening of the muscle disappears at the end of the stretch!

                subtitle: '2. The passive stretching method',
                content: `The passive or static stretching method should be done after exercise, especially neither before nor during, as many do!

                When the stretch is performed within a time range of 20 to 30 seconds, it is called a short passive stretch. This is to be done after exercise during what is called calm down.
                
                On the other hand, when the stretch lasts between 1 to 5 minutes, it is called a postural or long passive stretch, which should be done outside of exercise.
                
                However, to enjoy all their benefits, it is necessary to practice them almost every day at a moderate intensity; no need to strain the muscle too much, especially after physical exertion.
                
                In this technique, if the stretch is held for 20 to 30 seconds (short passive), the stretch disappears at the end of it. On the other hand, if it is held between 1 to 5 minutes (long passive or postural) the lengthening persists after the stretching; hence the increased flexibility.
                
                See also hatha yoga which mainly concerns spiritual awakening through correct postures, discipline of the breath and meditation. Today, it constitutes a practice in various forms relying on bodywork and the corresponding mental attitude (Wikipedia Hatha Yoga).

                content: `The activo-passive method consists in contracting the muscle using an isometric contraction, that is to say without movement, lasting 12 to 15 seconds.

                To understand the different types of contraction, check out this very pragmatic article: Concentric, Eccentric, and Isometric Contractions
                
                This contraction can be done with a light weight, a low resistance elastic band, the ground or a partner's hand.
                
                After that, a slackening ensues. Without changing the angle in which you are, take advantage of this so-called "refractory" period to lengthen the muscle in question.
                
                At this time, the muscle is less contracted, it can be stretched more easily. This method is also called CRE (contraction, relaxation, stretching); it is a technique that is part of what is called NPF (Proprioceptive Neuromuscular Facilitation). It should be done before exercise or independently of your sessions.
                
                Warning ! This method is very effective, because it is very easy to obtain amplitude gain. But this one takes a lot of listening and feeling. It is widely used by therapists; it should only be done by those who are used to stretching. Indeed, it requires a good knowledge of oneself and of one's body.
                Why stretch? What are the benefits of stretching?
                And imagine that the benefits of these are numerous and not negligible for our health.
                
                First, I would like to point out that stretching does not prevent stiffness and does not "cure" it; instead turn to my article on muscle soreness.
                
                Imagine if you have cuts on your skin, no one would think of pulling on the skin to heal faster!

                The jumps can be replaced by climbs of walk or step-up.

                It is also possible to DIY a first price rope to obtain a model supporting the comparison in speed of rotation with the high level ropes by replacing the original wire by a sheathed cable of 3 mm in diameter limited at these two ends by 3 mm sleeves.

                For an expert practitioner the rope can be much shorter and only arrive at the level of the last ribs or the navel for example. An expert in jumping can afford a shorter length because he will not tend to spread his arms when jumping, which is what a beginner always does.
                Technically, the ideal way to master double turns is to have your arms glued to the chest while jumping, to stimulate the rotational movement of the rope by the sole action of the wrists and to keep the legs straight and the body sheathed. .
