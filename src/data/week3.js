This is for several reasons such as the time factor and physical fatigue. There are still exceptions for so-called high level athletes, but I think that if we are here it is because we are not. On the other hand, someone who wants to maintain his physical condition without having intense activities at the same time will be able to perform these exercises on a daily basis without any problem.`

                content: `Too often neglected in physical preparation, the abdominals are nevertheless among the most essential muscles for work, whatever the discipline practiced.
                The abdominals being postural muscles, they are used, no matter what, on a daily basis. But that is not enough to develop them. The ideal training frequency: every other day or 3 to 4 times a week, to give them time to recover properly between each session.
                The abdominal muscles are divided into two parts: the superficial abdominals and the deep abdominals. The superficial abdominals are made up of the rectus abdominis (which runs from the lower part of the pectorals to the pubis) and obliques (located on the sides, they are separate from the rectus abdominis but are part of the abdominal strap training).
                The deep abdominals correspond to the transverse. The latter is deep, it surrounds the entire abdomen and brings the navel closer to the spine when exhaling. It is this muscle that helps keep your stomach flat.`,

                content: `It particularly works the rectus abdominis, the muscle that runs up and down the anterior wall of the abdomen. This is actually the muscle you need to work on to have the famous "chocolate bars" so adored by athletes and bodybuilders. It is the spinal curl bringing the bust closer to the pubis and thighs that is responsible for this result. The area above the navel is therefore the most reinforced. You can also work the deep abdominal or transverse muscle by doing a crunch. To achieve your goal, you must then contract your stomach well during the exercise.
                It should then be understood that crunch abs are aesthetic exercises that allow the abdominals to take shape. Yet, they are often wrongly practiced to lose belly fat. To reduce the abdominal perimeter, it is better to start by increasing the basal metabolism before moving on to muscle building.
                The video below will give you the best way to crunch.`,

Supporting the arms tones the biceps, triceps and deltoids. Finally, contraction and maintaining balance keep your back, glutes, hamstrings and quads working.
                This abdominal sheathing movement will not allow you to gain muscle mass or volume in the abs. The goal is more "internal" with the aim of strengthening the deep muscles. In addition, the board contributes to a better transmission of forces between the upper and lower body, as well as to work on balance, more or less extensive depending on the variants performed.`,

This exercise also works the cardio.The gesture is simple and very effective, it consists of lifting one knee towards the torso by contracting the abdominal belt. A variation is to orient the knee towards the opposite shoulder. This version is more effective but I advise you to start with the basic version during your first sessions then to vary the pleasures to avoid getting bored',
