The messenger would have died of fatigue just after delivering his message.

                Fundamental endurance is a running pace that you can theoretically run without stopping.
                Indeed, you are not out of breath at this rate; you are comfortable. Usually, this is the outing you do while chatting with your friends.
                This pace should be the basis of your training. It should represent 70% of your training volume because it helps develop many of your physical capacities.`,

                content: `By running a long time in fundamental endurance, you muscle your heart and you increase its volume. More powerful, the latter sends more blood into your body. Your heart rate (HR) then drops for the same effort.
                    By running regularly with this technique, you develop your capillarization. This is because your body will improve the network of capillaries that supply oxygen to your muscles. They will thus be able to benefit from more oxygen and be more efficient.
                    Endurance training increases the mitochondria in muscle fibers. These mitochondria, located in muscle cells, convert “glucose” into ATP, the energy that can be directly used by muscle cells. We quickly understand the importance of increasing this number of mitochondria in a context of progression and performance.
                    An ideal pace for soliciting fat and activating the lipid chain.
                    During long outings in fundamental endurance, and in particular on an empty stomach, the runner will make better use of lipid reserves.`

                    Running for a long time: whether on a trail, an ultra-trail, a 24 hour race or even a 100 kiosk, the goal is to last a long time. However, carbohydrate reserves are limited, unlike lipid reserves. To last over a long race, it will therefore be necessary to be able to use the lipid sector as effectively as possible.
                Pushing back the wall of the marathon: the wall of the marathon corresponds to the depletion of carbohydrate reserves and therefore the lack of energy. Training in fundamental endurance makes it possible to learn to use lipids as an energy chain and no longer rely solely on the carbohydrate chain.
                    Running in fundamental endurance is much less traumatic for the body than so-called "quality" (split) sessions. This is why you can hold this pace for a very long time.
            This pace will allow you to increase your weekly volume, whether running or trail running. Be careful, however, this increase in volume should be gradual to avoid injuring yourself (tendonitis, windshield wiper syndrome, etc.).
            As you tire your body less, you can run more often. So, to run every day, you will have to run no faster than this pace.`,

Concretely, on mixed ground, I prefer to take my indestructible Nike Pegasus than my Adios Boost, which wear out at high speed as soon as they leave the track or the asphalt ...

                Others are lighter and more dynamic, like the Salomon S-Lab sense or the NB Hierro. It's up to you to see which ones suit you best and be careful not to hurt yourself by favoring lightness at all costs!

                For example, I weigh around 60 kg, I don't have the same constraints as a 90 kg runner. You should know that with each support on the ground, the runner absorbs 2 to 4 times his body weight. It is therefore preferable to choose the cushioning according to your weight. Thus, a light and dynamic shoe like an Adidas Adios Boost will be suitable for me up to 10 km, or even semi with a little training, while for a heavier runner, the Adios may be to be reserved for split or short competitions like the 5 km. Adidas Ultra Boost or Nike Pegasus may be more suitable for most outings. The Nike Pegasus are also particularly versatile and comfortable.
                The main point is to really feel good in your sneakers when you run. Just because a running shoe is more expensive, lighter, doesn't mean it will suit you better!`
