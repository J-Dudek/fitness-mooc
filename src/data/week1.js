The activity was considered indecent for girls because they might show their ankles. Girls began to jump rope in the 18th century, adding skipping chants, owning the rope, controlling the game, and deciding who may participate.In the United States, domination of the activity by girls occurred when their families moved into the cities in the late 19th century. There, they found sidewalks and other smooth surfaces conducive to jumping rope, along with a host of contemporaries.

                The jumps can be replaced by climbs of walk or step-up.
                Athletes prone to tendonitis, in particular the Achilles tendon, also have an interest in not skipping rope even for a very short time.

                We will rather orient ourselves towards vinyl, leather or steel strings sheathed with ball bearings if we are trained and if we want to perform the double-under (double turns) during the wod (training sessions) of crossfit.
                It is also possible to DIY a first price rope to obtain a model supporting the comparison in speed of rotation with the high level ropes by replacing the original wire by a sheathed cable of 3 mm in diameter limited at these two ends by 3 mm sleeves.
                You can even replace the original foam grip with a tennis racket grip that is easier to handle by simply rotating the wrists.`

                For an expert practitioner the rope can be much shorter and only arrive at the level of the last ribs or the navel for example. An expert in jumping can afford a shorter length because he will not tend to spread his arms when jumping, which is what a beginner always does.
                Technically, the ideal way to master double turns is to have your arms glued to the chest while jumping, to stimulate the rotational movement of the rope by the sole action of the wrists and to keep the legs straight and the body sheathed. .
